This was our final team project in Java 2 completed with my classmate, Minjung.

It was my first GUI CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applicationn. I learned to apply concepts including Object-Oriented Programming, CRUD on ArrayList, MVC, Data Validation (empty field, wrong data type entered), Logic for Search and Update, UML Class Diagram, using MS Visio, and Scene Builder JavaFX.

This program is designed to keep a daily journal of health-related data such as glasses of water, meals, hours of sleep, calories burned, amount of exercise.
